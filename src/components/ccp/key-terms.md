### Key Terms:
- **Dining Philosophers**
- **Producer-Consumer**
	- Producers and consumers access the buffer in mutual exclusion
	- Consumers block when the buffer is empty
	- Producers block when the buffer is full (bounded buffer variant)
	- Arbitrary number, deadlock free, starvation free
- **Boards**
- **Barriers**: A barrier is a form of synchronization where there is a point (the barrier) in a program’s execution that all threads in a group have to reach before any of them is allowed to continue
- **Reusable barrier**: implement Barrier such that:
	- a thread blocks on wait until all threads have reached the barrier
	- after expected # of threads have executed wait, the barrier is closed again
- **Reader-writer problem**: Implement Board data structure such that:
	- multiple reader can operate concurrently
	- each writer has exclusive access
- **Monitor**: A monitor is an object instantiating a monitor class that encapsulates synchronization mechanisms:
	- attributes are shared variables, which all threads running on the monitor can see and modify
	- methods define critical sections, with the built-in guarantee that at most one thread is active on a monitor at any time
- **Condition**
  - c.wait() blocks the running thread, appends it to blocked, and releases the lock on the monitor
  - c.signal() removes one thread from blocked (if it’s not empty) and unblocks it
  - c.isEmpty() returns true iff blocked is empty
